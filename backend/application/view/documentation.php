		Mogul MVC is an MVC framework for quickly building well organized web applications. It's designed to be fast, have a small footprint, work on shared hosting, and not require the installation of any additional software.

		It is broken up into three code bases, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. All three are designed to work together. You will see similar class and function names being used between all three code bases.
